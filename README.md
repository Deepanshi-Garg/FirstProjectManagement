- It helps in better understanding of tasks for a team collaboration.
- It makes it clear that which task is to done when and by whom.
- Better understanding makes it easy to deliver features on time and with better quality.
- As all things are going to handled on a single platform i.e., GitHub which also makes it reliable.

## Explain why you chose these issues and how they contribute to achieving the milestone.

### Issues which I link with milestone "Develop a User friendly home page for Blog Website" are:
- Complete creating navbar first 
- Add Signup Form
- Add Login Form

**As the milestone focuses on the development of home page that,s why I added issues like above. These tasks focused on the development of Home page.**
